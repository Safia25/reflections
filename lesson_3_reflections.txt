When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are collabortaing with multiple people who are all working remotely. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may not like all the changes/commits that have been added to GitHub directly. Perhaps you don't agree with a commit another collaborator made, and you want to keep your local copy of the master "clean"

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork = Clone a repo hosted git hub to your github profile (stays on github server)
Clone = Same idea as forking but you can clone a local repo
Branch = A series of commits
